# Undertale
I welcome everyone who came to my directory. Here you will find the code for my website about undertale. It is written in romanian as it was my project for school. During the creation of the project, I encountered a couple of problems.
* ### The first was the connection of fonts, and in particular the rubik font-family
I solved it by converting the font in .ttf format into readable formats for all browsers (so my site will now display fonts correctly even in Internet Explorer :) ) 
* ### The second was the correct display of elements in the navigation block
I used flex to make the distance between elements always remainin the same no matter what width the screen has
* ### And the last problem was and probably remains the non-working autoplay attribute for music
It's a separate page if you click on the 'undertale' banner. It is working on some PC's including mine, but on othrs music doesn't play due to Google's new updates after many complaint about unwanted ads
